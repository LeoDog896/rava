# rava

Java in rust.

**NOTE:** This is *not* a replacement for the JVM or GraalVM. Those are generally much faster projects, and the aim of this is to have a Java language that can run inside browsers for educational purposes.

## Idea

`rava` aims to have parity with the latest OpenJDK version. *However*, `rava` should put out helpful error messages when possible, but still use the same error types as Java.
